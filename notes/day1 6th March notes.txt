vscode
python 3.13







starting point

1. Intent first,langauge next.

Architecture..
do you know what will change..

decision making means you need to consider
time factor



Programmer..
1. respect architecture
2. tolerate uncertainty... this is important.
3. generalize your leanring..

full stack programming..

1. business logic (5/5)
2. database part (2/5)
3. presentation part (3/5)
4. unit testing (2/5)
5. cloud... (1/5)


what is web?
http protocol usage.

https://www.cleartrip.com/

distributed computing..
service runnnin on one system
calling happening on other system..

api...

summary
1. loyalty towards project.
1.1 multiple files.
1.2 presentation, service, database layer
1.3 presentation separated into view, model and controller.
2. http means web..
3. web for presentation... end target is browser...
web as a cover for the service function so that
we can make it distributed... 
0. programmer must tolerate uncertainty and not
make a scene when he/she gets struck..... willingness
to write a small program to clarify the doubt on
syntax or concept is a must.... 
generalize learning so that we can remember less.



importance of valuing collaboration..

void f2(int *p)
{
*p =44;

}


void f1()
{

int i =3;
f2(&i);

}

this code is written by a person who is unemployed
and busy...






 as a programmer we need to be 5/5 in variables
and functions..

function
1. function definition
think who is going to call it, if you dont know
dont define it.
2. function calling
open documentation..
3. function assignment
remember this is not function calling.

varaibles.
data type 
scope..




project success =
process * technology * tools *culture.

Event...
Event source
1. something happens
2. must be intimated to others..(notification mechanism)


Event Listener
1. person interested in the event.
2. he has to register with the event source.
3. some function will be called by the event source
when event occurs.


http protocol

request...
request...

mention URI...

when we make a request.

1. we are mentioning the http mode of request...
default mode of request is get..
we mention where the request should be processed..
request processing thing is event handling function...


@app.route("/")
we told hey look if types ip address

http://localhost:5000/ in get mode of request..
event hanlding function that will process
the request will get called, whatever
it returns will be the response..

I want to work on X, X needs Y
I dont know Y, challenge is learn Y quickly
and come back to X and not do phd on Y and forget X

X= run my application.
Y = virtual environment in python..

1. clone the link.
https://github.com/noteonbg/BMSIT.git

2. there is a folder called.
a00_all
create a virtual environment .
activate it.
install flask..
then run the program a00app.py.
python a00app.py
localhost:8080
and run the program see do you get output.



any person who does not know his project
folder structure is unfit in a project.






we have a request processing function
what does the function  return
some view.. html page... makeupset target.. browser...

request processing function return is some data
target is some other application... and not browser.

how do I start my web journey...

1. where does the request start.
2. what is the URI...
3. decide your mode of request.
4. decide what you want to send.
5. register for the event.
6. when the event handling gets called, you 
read from the request, and decide what
will be your response..(X)
x for makeup
X for web service.. wrapper on the chocolate.

JSON... kids anxiety.. expand it. JavaScript Object
Notation..

JSON is a standard for representating variables.
it is a standard.. that means java will agree
python and javascript will agree.

standard means everybody agree...
JSON

1. standard for representing variables.
2  in every language we can convert a json
string into an object of that language
and vice versa.

we have an object with us.. in form of a json.
{
"length":3;
"breadth:4

}
