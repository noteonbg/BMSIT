learn some design patterns.

1. observer.
2. strategy
3. template
4. proxy
5. singleton
6. factory.



cloud.
availability of resource on demand
possible only if you write web services
because for cloud usage distributed computing
is a must.

security
who are you
what you can access.
applicable only at web services level...

unit testing..
unit testing can done to act like a documentation
for our code...
and ok we prove our code is working..
biggest problem is culture of the team will they
do it or not...


database.
why use database .. physical and logical independence of
data.. what is meaning of it...

we have a table in a database called emp.
we have got columsn empno and empname.
we put two rows into the table.
1, A
2, B

lateron due to project need we modified.
the table emp to have email.
old details 1, A and 2,B is not lost...

but if we have a class called Emp
in that we have empno and empname.
we created two objects obj1, and ojb2
and wrote to the file
and class changes now, old details of obj1
and obj2 cannot be read from the file.

in a database..
database is a superset.
in the database

tables.
views
indexes
stored procedures
triggers
stored functions.

please try to find out 
which database you are planning to use
how to going to view the data which tools
you plan to use...

simple database sqllite..
to visualize the code.. i am going to use a tool
dbviewer.. this is my opinion as of now. you can
have other options also...




database code.. crud operation
insert
update
select
delete.

insert 
   constraint violation..
update
	where condition failure
select
	you get some rows from the table
and you have copy these rows into some datastrucure.
delete 
	where condition failure
take care of success and failures..

1. Dbbrowser you download... and install it.
2. a02initdb.py run this
3. see in your folder whether product.db is creating
created.
4. open dbbrowser utility and point to product.db
5. run the program a04database.py
6. run the program a06check.py
7. run the program a05web service. py thru postman
and see whether it works.
